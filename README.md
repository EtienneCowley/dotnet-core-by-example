### [.NET 8 Blazor Vertical Slice Architecture Sample](https://github.com/ricofritzsche/dotnet-core-by-example/tree/main/FeatureSlicesWithBlazor)
A cutting-edge .NET 8 Blazor Web App project that showcases the implementation of the vertical slice architecture. By eschewing the traditional controller-based approach, this sample demonstrates a streamlined and feature-focused structure that elevates maintainability and scalability in modern web applications. Leveraging the power of .NET 8, the project provides a practical example of how to organize and structure a Blazor application into cohesive vertical slices. Each slice represents a self-contained feature with its own request, processing, and response flow, fostering a clean separation of concerns and modular development.
